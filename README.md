## 🔋VoltioVivo - Founder

Mission-driven software + hardware company improving grid reliability and outage visibility in Puerto Rico.

Founded VoltioVivo to address chronic power instability and the lack of real-time, trustworthy outage data following widespread infrastructure failures.

Built a first-of-its-kind deterministic power outage prediction platform combining:

- Distributed mesh network of low-power hardware nodes  
- Real-time telemetry ingestion  
- Deterministic fault-detection & outage prediction algorithms  
- Cloud analytics, alerting, and visualization stack  

VoltioVivo became the first system on the island capable of instantaneous, ground-truth outage reporting, independent of utility self-reporting systems. The platform enabled faster response, improved situational awareness, and data-driven identification of high-risk grid segments.

Successfully funded and later acquired by a private equity group. I remain a close adviser, supporting architecture, product direction, and long-term technical strategy.

**Highlights**

- Deterministic outage prediction at regional scale  
- Island-wide mesh telemetry coverage  
- Sub-minute outage detection and reporting  
- Full-stack software + hardware platform  
- Founder → acquisition lifecycle
